# 블로그 개설 축사

Congratulations on your new blog, Jerry!

I've been watched over Jerry for a long time, creating his own blog was a challenge he has been constantly trying.
There were huge obstacles like choosing a programming language, choosing a framework, or a choosing a theme,
He finally realized the hidden secret that the content is important and settled on a simple and developer-like theme.

I want to give you some advices.  
First, don't spend a lot of time to revise the content. Anyway, not tons of people will not visit this blog to make you nervous.  
Second, To avoid the situation that only this post remains, prepare the next post quickly.  
Third, Despite all these circumstances, please make it this place that the posts that only you can write and the posts that you can feel yourself are full.  

Good luck!
